FINAL PROJECT

To summarize the steps in the project, we are going to make topics, 
which will serve as a guide to the data wrangling pipeline.

FIRST TOPIC -> DATA LOADING:

Here, we are going to use web scraping and data from csv files. 
To make this possible, we have the scraping tools,
the csv data loading tool and the data combination tools.

SECOND TOPIC -> DATA VIS:

To get a better understanding about the data, the data visualization
packages will be used. This kind of visualization will help us in the 
process of understanding the data, which will be massively used in the
next step.

THIRD TOPIC -> DATA PROCESSING:

This topic is the last one, and will be related to the data processing.
This topic will give the results based on the goal of the project, which
can be various kinds of data analysis. Furthermore, data processing will be 
used in the second topic as well, to help in the data visualization and
understanding.

DATASET:

The dataset we are going to use is one about the matches in all the world cups.
For that, we are going to use a csv with all the matches until
2014. For 2018 and we are going to use web scraping and integration.
