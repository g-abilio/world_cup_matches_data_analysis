# Final Project of Data Wrangling with Python, by University of Colorado Boulder

This project is a study about World Cup matches, with the aim to 
gather as much information as possible about this topic, such as
the frequency of results, the most victorius country, the country
with the most losses, the biggest win, and so on. 

The dataset is going to be an integration between a csv file and 
data provided by web scraping. We are going to have data 
visualization and understanding, and data processing and manipulation,
which will give us a amazing analysis of the dataset in focus.
